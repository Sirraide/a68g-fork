> Issue: a68g 2.6, Bus Error on SPARC
>        Target machine is Sun SPARCStation 10 with two SM81 SuperSPARC II CPU 
>        modules, 512M memory. OS is NetBSD 4.0.
>        Some regression tests cause a Bus Error, typically caused by unaligned fetch, 
>        SPARC being one of the architectures that do not support unaligned fetches at all.
> Status: unable to reproduce on non-SPARC machines, no access to SPARCs.
